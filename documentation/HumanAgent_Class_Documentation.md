HumanAgent Class Documentation

## Class Overview

### Class Name: `HumanAgent`

The `HumanAgent` class simulates a human participant in a multi-agent system. This agent manages messages and memory but does not use tools or large language models (LLMs). It is primarily used to simulate human interactions or as a placeholder for a real user within the system.

### Attributes:
- **name (str)**: The name of the agent.
- **role (str)**: The role assigned to the agent.
- **role_description (str)**: A description of the agent's role.
- **pre_processing_tools (None)**: Placeholder for consistency with other agent classes; not used in `HumanAgent`.
- **post_processing_tools (None)**: Placeholder for consistency with other agent classes; not used in `HumanAgent`.
- **memory (Memory)**: An instance of the `Memory` class for managing the agent's memory.

## Function Descriptions

### `__init__(self, name, role, role_description)`
Initializes the `HumanAgent` with the given name, role, and role description.

#### Parameters:
- **name (str)**: The name of the agent.
- **role (str)**: The role assigned to the agent.
- **role_description (str)**: A description of the agent's role.

### `get_state(self)`
Retrieves the current state of the agent, including memory and tool history.

#### Returns:
- **dict**: A dictionary containing the agent's name, role, short-term memory, tool history, and placeholders for tools and LLM.

### `init_messages(self)`
Initializes the agent's stored messages list, used for simulating message handling.

### `update_messages(self, message)`
Updates the agent's short-term memory with a new message.

#### Parameters:
- **message (str)**: The message to be added to the short-term memory.

#### Returns:
- **list**: The updated short-term memory.

### `reset(self)`
Resets the agent's messages and reinitializes its message storage.

### `step(self, input_message)`
Simulates the agent's response to an input message by returning the message as-is.

#### Parameters:
- **input_message (str)**: The input message received by the agent.

#### Returns:
- **str**: The same input message, simulating a simple echo behavior.

### `clone(self)`
Creates a clone of the current agent, including its memory.

#### Returns:
- **HumanAgent**: A new instance of `HumanAgent` with the same configuration and memory state.

### `end(self)`
Finalizes the agent's session. Currently, this method does nothing, but it can be extended for cleanup operations if needed.

## Detailed Algorithm Explanations

### Agent Initialization
1. **Initialization**: When an instance of `HumanAgent` is created, it initializes its attributes and creates an instance of the `Memory` class for managing memory.
2. **Logging**: The initialization process logs the agent's name, role, and description for tracking purposes.

### State Management
- The `get_state` method retrieves the current state of the agent, including its memory and tool history, and logs the action for debugging.

### Message Handling
- The `init_messages` method initializes the agent's stored messages, while `update_messages` adds new messages to the short-term memory and logs the update.
- The `reset` method clears the stored messages and reinitializes the message storage.

### Cloning
- The `clone` method creates a new instance of `HumanAgent` with the same attributes and a copy of the current agent's short-term memory.

## Basic Examples

### Creating a HumanAgent Instance
```python
agent = HumanAgent(name="Alice", role="User", role_description="A human user in the system.")
```

### Retrieving Agent State
```python
state = agent.get_state()
```

### Updating Messages
```python
updated_memory = agent.update_messages("Hello, how are you?")
```

### Resetting the Agent
```python
agent.reset()
```

### Simulating a Step
```python
response = agent.step("What is your name?")
```

### Cloning the Agent
```python
cloned_agent = agent.clone()
```

## Expected Outputs
- Retrieving the agent's state will return a dictionary with the agent's details and memory.
- Updating messages will return the updated short-term memory list.
- Cloning the agent will create a new `HumanAgent` instance with the same attributes and memory.
